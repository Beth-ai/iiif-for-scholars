### Finding IIIF-hosted Images across the Web

Many institutions are adopting IIIF to host their image collections (including UCLA!). When visiting a digital library collection, look for the IIIF logo and the Mirador or Universal Viewers. Here is a curated list (probably not up-to-date) of IIIF collections that you might find useful: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1apQKFkfBV89BvycaBPN6v-LjeaKaVVMaMUsY6L4KRJo/edit#gid=0

Currently there is no way to search across all IIIF-hosted content, but there are a few initiatives underway that are working to get us closer to this goal:

* Biblissima's **IIIF Collection - Manuscripts and Rare Books**: https://iiif.biblissima.fr/collections/. A prototype for searching across IIIF-compliant manuscripts and rare books dated before 1800 coming from many digital libraries in the world. (Work in progress).

* **iiif-universe**: https://github.com/ryanfb/iiif-universe/. Basically, a collection of IIIF collections in a JSON manifest.

* **OCLC ResearchWorks IIIF Explorer**: https://researchworks.oclc.org/iiif-explorer/. An index of all of the IIIF compliant images in the CONTENTdm digital content management systems hosted by OCLC.
