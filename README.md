Access to image-based resources (manuscripts, artworks, maps, etc.) is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework), a framework for interoperable image delivery, gives an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world enabling scholars to view, annotate, and remix digital images (http://iiif.io).

In this workshop, participants will learn basic IIIF concepts and technologies, and will work with IIIF-hosted content to explore the benefits and scholar use-cases through discussion and hands-on exercises. No prior experience is assumed, but you will need to bring a laptop and have a GitHub account to participate in all the hands-on exercises. If you do not already have one, you can sign up for a GitHub account here: https://github.com.
